\title{Extract posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) from BKMR model fit}
\usage{
ExtractPIPs(fit, sel = NULL, z.names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{fitted BKMR model with either component-wise or hierarchical variable selection}

\item{sel}{optional argument selecting which iterations of the MCMC sampler to keep}

\item{z.names}{optional argument providing the names of the variables included in the \code{h} function.}
}
\value{
a data frame with the variable-specific PIPs for BKMR fit with component-wise variable selection, and with the group-specific and conditional (within-group) PIPs for BKMR fit with hierarchical variable selection.
