The R package `bkmr` implements Bayesian kernel machine regression, a statistical approach for estimating the joint health effects of multiple concurrent exposures. Additional information on the statistical methodology and on the computational details are provided in [Bobb et al. 2015](http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/3/493).

You can install `bkmr` from github with:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jenfb/bkmr")
```
